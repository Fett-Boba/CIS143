# Usecase
The following homework is to apply the learning of using an iterator for dealing a deck of cards. It is very similar to the lab for cards, however, you will need to:
1. Create the cards in a ArrayList.
2. Have a class variable that is the iterator of the ArrayList.

You will use the iterator to do the dealing of the cards.

# You TODO
1. Create a file called DeckIteratorImpl.
2. Implement the Deck interface (supplied) on the DeckIteratorImpl file.
3. Implement the business logic using an ArrayList and Iterator.
4. Uncomment the code in the DockerIteratorTest file.
5. Make sure that all the tests run in the DeckIteratorTest (the same tests as DeckTest file has) and pass against the DeckIteratorImpl.
