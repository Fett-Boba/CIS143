# Use Case
You need to complete the implemenation of the DeckImpl file in order to manage a deck of cards.
Note that this deck of cards acts like an iterator in that once a card is delt, it is removed from the deck.

# File
You will be working on implementing functionality in the DeckImpl file in order to pass the DeckerTest test.

# You TODO

1. Add add the functional code required for you to manage the stack. This is done by completing the business logic in the DeckImpl file. Once completed, you must be able to run the DeckTest file without error.
2. Create an interface called Deck.java in this folder.
3. Add the public methods from DeckImpl file to the newly created Deck interface. 
4. Add the implementation of the Deck interface to DeckImpl.
5. Update the DeckTest file to use the interface rather than the implementation when testing methods.
