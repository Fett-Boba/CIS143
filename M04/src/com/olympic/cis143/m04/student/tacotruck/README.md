# Use Case
For the list labs, you will be extending the order management system for our taco truck.

Note that the class (set/OrdersSetImpl) has already been created for you and you just need to fill in the blanks.

Note that this must be a FIFO implemeation using a Set.

As always, run the OrdersTest file to ensure that your alg works.
