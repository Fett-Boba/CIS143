# Use Case
For this homework you will be adding functionality to the Tacotruck. In short, you will associate an orderidd with a list of tacos.

In order to do this, you will need to have a Map (HashMap) defined that will have a String as its key and a list of TacoImpl as its value.

Note that this homework introduces a new feature set to the taco truck so that the original Orders interface has changed.

## Tip

Do not forget to read the Java docs for Orders as it will give you a few clues on what is required.
